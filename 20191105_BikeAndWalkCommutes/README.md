## TidyTuesday 2019-11-05 - A Glimpse on the Modes Less Traveled Dataset from ACS by Lasse Scheele

This weeks dataset included a [census of squirrels](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-29) from Central Park in NYC. I had a look at the spatial distributions of primary fur color and behaviour towards humans.

### Primary Fur Color

- the black squirrels are seen more often in the north
